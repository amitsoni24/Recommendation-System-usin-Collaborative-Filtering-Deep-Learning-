# Recommendation-System-using-Collaborative-Filtering-Deep-Learning-
Deep learning and collaborative filtering-based recommendation system that predicts user-item interactions, leveraging neural networks and hybrid techniques to provide personalized product or content recommendations

## Project Overview
This project implements a recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset (`ml-latest-small`). The dataset contains 100,836 ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9,742 movies, generated by 610 users. The system predicts user preferences and recommends movies using collaborative filtering and deep learning techniques.

## Dataset
- **Ratings**: `ratings.csv` – User ratings for movies on a 0.5–5 star scale.
- **Tags**: `tags.csv` – User-generated tags for movies.
- **Movies**: `movies.csv` – Movie details including title and genres.
- **Links**: `links.csv` – External IDs linking movies to IMDB and TMDB.

## Features
- User-User Collaborative Filtering
- Item-Item Collaborative Filtering
- Neural Collaborative Filtering (Deep Learning)
- Autoencoder-based Recommendations
- Evaluation using RMSE and MAE

## Data Processing
- Users and movies are represented as nodes.
- Ratings and tag interactions are used to generate relationships.
- Genres are used to enhance content-based filtering.
